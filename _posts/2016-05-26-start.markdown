title: Start Genymotion Player from Command line

As of Genymotion 2.6.0 (Dec 2015), it appears they have moved the `player` executable to be `player.app`

On OSX you can launch a desired VM like this:

```
# First, get a list of the VM's you have installed
VBoxManage list vms

# Returns something like "5.0.0 - API 21 - 768x1280" {091d022d-6a7b-4475-845f-7a6e06024fb6}
```

Copy the VM ID, e.g. 091d022d-6a7b-4475-845f-7a6e06024fb6, and then use it again like this:

```
# Launch a specific VM
open -a /Applications/Genymotion.app/Contents/MacOS/player.app --args --vm-name '091d022d-6a7b-4475-845f-7a6e06024fb6'
```

**Bonus:**

I used `alias` to start my player more handy:

1. Add following line to `~/.bash_profile`:

    ```
    alias geny5="open -a /Applications/Genymotion.app/Contents/MacOS/player.app --args --vm-name '091d022d-6a7b-4475-845f-7a6e06024fb6'"
    ```
    I used `geny5` to determine that it's **Android 5.0**
    
1. Run `source` command to apply change.

    ```
    source ~/.bash_profile
    ```
    
1. Start player:

    ```
    geny5
    ```
