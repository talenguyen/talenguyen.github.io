My name is Nguyen Truong Giang. I’m software engineer (mainly Android) and author of some open source projects. Now, I’m working as Senior Software Engineer at Tiki.vn. This is my personal blog where I publish technical articles about android, software architecture, user interfaces and user experience. I’m a sports enthusiast, especially football.

Thanks for reading!
